AWS - EC2 (ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD)
----------------------------------
>EC2 is a web service provides elastic compute capacity in the cloud
>is a virtual machine represents a physical server to deploy your applications
>have a CPU, RAM ,DISK

WHY & ADVANTAGES
-----------------
>scale your instances up or down as you need
>different types of instance to match the workloads
>flexible with various operating systems, storage options and network configurations.
>secure with security groups and key-pair for access
>maintenance free being a public cloud
  eg:- timely updates, security issues, server uptime
>management effort
>cost effective - pay as you go
>can be deployed in multiple locations for high availability and fault tolerance
 
KEY COMPONENTS
--------------
>AMI -amazon machine image is a operating system run on ec2
>instance type - can select instance as we need
>instance state - can start, stop and terminate instance


  

TYPES
-----
>General Purpose instances 
  >deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network 
  resources. 
  >used for wide range of applications,   
  including web servers,small databases, development and 
  test environments, and more.

>Compute Optimized instances 
  >provide a higher ratio of compute power to memory.  
  >used for high-performance processing such as batch 
  processing,scientific\modeling, gaming servers, and 
  high-performance web servers.

>Memory Optimized instances 
  >are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads.
  >used for applications that require large amounts of 
  memory, such as in-memory databases,real-time big data 
  analytics, and high-performance computing.

>Storage Optimized instances 
  >are optimized for applications that require high, 
  sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
  >They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log 
  processing, and distributed file systems.

>Accelerated Computing Instances 
  >typically come with one or more types of accelerators, 
  such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field 
  Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), or custom Application 
  Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
  >These accelerators offload computationally intensive 
  tasks from the main CPU, enabling faster and more 
  efficient processing for specific workloads.
